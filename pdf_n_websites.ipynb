       "\" Based on the given context, it seems that branch change is a highly competitive process at IITR. The rules for branch change are subject to frequent changes and only 10% of total seats in any branch are open for incoming branch changers. Additionally, the strength of any branch should not fall more than 25% due to outgoing BCs. To be eligible for branch change, one must maintain a good GPA and not fail any courses. The process involves choosing courses from one's own department's electives to meet a quota of 18 credits and possibly pursuing departmental honors. Audits, which are not graded, are also an option for students in their third year. Branch change is a challenging and intense process, with students competing for limited spots in their desired branch.\""
